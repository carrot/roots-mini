An opinionated static build tool, powered by [webpack](http://webpack.github.io)

## Why should you care?

[We](https://github.com/carrot) [:heart:](http://giphy.com/gifs/steve-carell-cute-the-office-Yb8ebQV8Ua2Y0/tile) [static](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/).

If you're building a website or client-side app â€“ then :cactus: spike is probably for you. Spike aims to be simple, efficient, and a pleasure to use.

Spike certainly is not the only [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) out there, but in our opinion, it's the most powerful and easiest to use.

> Spike is from the same [team](https://github.com/carrot) that brought you [Roots](http://roots.cx). The thinking behind moving past Roots is explained in [this article](https://medium.com/@jescalan/eaa10c75eb22). Please feel free to comment and contribute.

### The Stack

Spike is fairly strict in enforcing a default stack. However, the stack allows for quite a large amount of flexibility as both the css and js parsers are able to accept plugins. Also spike's core compiler is [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), so you can customize your project with [loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html) and [plugins](https://webpack.github.io/docs/plugins.html). The inflexibility of the stack means faster compiles and better stability. We use...

- [pug](http://jade-lang.com/) for markup
- [babel](https://babeljs.io/) for JS and JS transforms
- [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for CSS transforms
- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) as the core compiler

### Features

- Easy configuration via the `app.js` file
- Integration with [Webpack's](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) massive plugin/loader ecosystem
- Support for ES6 in your site's JS via Babel
- Breezy local development powered by [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
- Turn-key isomorphism (no refresh page loads)
- Selective compile in `watch` mode :zap:
- Support for [multiple environments](#environments)
- Interactive Project Starters via [sprout](https://github.com/carrot/sprout)
- [Spike Plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/spikeplugin) for common integrations

## Installation

- `npm install spike-core`

## Usage

Spike operates through a carefully crafted javascript interface. If you are looking to use spike through its command line interface, check out [spike](https://github.com/static-dev/spike). This project is just the core javascript api.

### Javacript API

The Spike module exposes a single class through which all functionality operates. An instance of the class should be created for each project being compiled with Spike.

```javascript
import Spike from 'spike-core'

let project = new Spike({ root: 'path/to/project/root' })
```

The above shows a minimal instantiation, but the constructor accepts a wide variety of options, listed below.

> **Note:** Not familiar with minimatch or micromatch? Check out the [minimatch cheat sheet](https://github.com/motemen/minimatch-cheat-sheet) and test your patterns with [globtester](http://www.globtester.com). Trust us, it's a much cleaner and easier way to write regexes for the file system : )

Spike exposes a simpler and more straightforward configuration interface than if you were to set up the webpack configuration yourself. However, if you'd like to directly edit the webpack config, you can still do this after the project has been instantiated through the `config` property on each instance.

```javascript
let project = new Spike({ root: 'path/to/project/root' })
console.log(project.config) // echoes bare webpack config object, can be edited
```

If you decide to edit the webpack config object directly, _be careful_. It is easy to break the way spike works without knowing exactly what you are doing here. If there's something you are looking to customize that is not part of spike' options, it's better to open an issue and ask for it to be made customizable, then we'll get you a much cleaner way to do it!

Note that each project is an event emitter, and all feedback on what the project is doing will come back through events on the `project` instance. Currently the following events are supported:

- `compile`: the project has finished compiling
- `warning`: the project has emitted a warning - not fatal but should be checked out
- `error`: the project has errored and will not complete compilation
- `remove`: spike has removed a particular path

To compile an instantiated project, you can run `project.compile()`. This method will synchronously return a unique id, which can be used to track events related to this particular compile if necessary. You must be listening for the events you are interested in **before** calling `compile` if you want to ensure that you will get all feedback.

## Creating a New Project

If you want to create a new project from a template, you can use the `Spike.new` static method. This method utilizes [sprout](https://github.com/carrot/sprout) to create a new project template.

Option       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Default
:----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------
**root**     | **[required]** An absolute path to the root of your project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
**template** | Name of the template you want to use to initialize your project. At the moment this is not configurable, but it will be in the future.                                                                                                                                                     | `base`
**src**      | Must be provided if you pass a custom `template` - a url that can be `git clone`-d in order to pull down your template.                                                                                                                                                                    | `https://github.com/static-dev/spike-tpl-base.git`
**locals**   | If your template [accepts options](https://github.com/carrot/sprout#initjs), you can pass them in here.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
**emitter**  | In order to get feedback from the method on how it is progressing through the new template creation progress, pass in an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) instance here and it will emit `info`, `error`, and `done` events where appropriate. |
**inquirer** | If you want to collect locals from the user via CLI, you can pass in an instance of [inquirer.prompt](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#installation) here.                                                                                                                         |

Utilizing `Spike.new` is fairly straightforward, here's a brief example of how it could be used to collect template locals from the command line using inquirer:

```javascript
const Spike = require('spike-core')
const inquirer = require('inquirer')
const {EventEmitter} = require('events')
const emitter = new EventEmitter()

emitter.on('info', console.log)
emitter.on('error', console.error)
emitter.on('done', (p) => console.log(`project created at ${p.config.context}`))

Spike.new({
  root: 'path/to/future/project',
  emitter: emitter,
  inquirer: inquirer.prompt.bind(inquirer)
})
```

## Templates

You can use a variety of different templates when creating new spike projects, and these templates can be controlled through a couple of functions in the `Spike.template` namespace. Any async function in this namespace utilizes a user-provided event emitter in place of a promise or callback, as some functions can take a while to run and provide information about their progress along the way.

To add a new template, you can use `Spike.template.add`, as such:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events')
const emitter = new EventEmitter()

emitter.on('info', console.log)
emitter.on('error', console.error)
emitter.on('success', console.log)

Spike.template.add({
  name: 'test',
  src: 'https://github.com/test/test',
  emitter: emitter
})
```

All templates are handled by [sprout](https://github.com/carrot/sprout), so you can read the [writing your own templates](https://github.com/carrot/sprout#writing-your-own-templates) section for direction on how to create one. It's a pretty simple process!

To remove an existing template, you can use `Spike.template.remove`, as such:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events')
const emitter = new EventEmitter()

emitter.on('info', console.log)
emitter.on('success', console.log)

Spike.template.remove({ name: 'test' emitter: emitter })
```

It will return a message as a string stating whether the template was successfully added or not.

To make a template the default for new projects, you can use `Spike.template.default`, as such:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events')
const emitter = new EventEmitter()

emitter.on('info', console.log)
emitter.on('error', console.log)
emitter.on('success', console.log)

Spike.template.default({ name: 'test' emitter: emitter })
```

It will return a message as a string stating whether the template was successfully made the default or not.

Since this is a synchronous function, it will also return its value directly if you don't want to use an event emitter:

```js
const result = Spike.template.default({ name: 'test' emitter: emitter })
console.log(result)
```

If you'd like to see a list of all the templates that have been added to Spike, you can use `Spike.template.list`, as such:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events')
const emitter = new EventEmitter()

emitter.on('info', console.log)
emitter.on('success', console.log)

Spike.template.list({ emitter: emitter })
```

It will return an array of all existing templates.

This is also a sync function and will return its results directly if you don't want to use an event emitter:

```js
const result = Spike.template.list()
console.log(result)
```

Finally, if you really screwed up with the templates and would like to wipe the slate clean, you can run `Spike.template.reset()`. This will synchronously remove all the global template configuration and bring it back to a default state, as it is when Spike is first installed.

## Environments

If you have different environments you intend to deploy to that need different settings, this is **[no probalo](http://www.hrwiki.org/w/images/8/85/Senor_Cardgage_shirt_close.PNG)**. Just make a second `app.js` file, but stick the name of your environment between the `app` and the `js`, like this: `app.production.js`. Now, when you initialize spike with the `production` environment, it will merge your production config (with priority) into your normal app config.

So let's say you have an app config that looks like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ignores: [...],
  locals: {
    apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1'
  }
}
```

If you wanted to update that API url to a real one for production, you could set up an `app.production.js` file that looks like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  locals: {
    apiUrl: 'http://real-website.com/api/v1'
  }
}
```

Since the two configuration files are _merged_, you don't lose all your other settings from the `app.js` file, it just merges in any new ones from `app.production.js`. Very amaze!

To change the environment, from javascript, just pass an `env` option to the spike constructor.
